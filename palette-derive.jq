# Fills in every palette slot for every theme in palettes.json.
#
# The slots are the ones gruvbox-material defines (bg_dim, bg0..bg5, greys,
# orange, visual/diff backgrounds, ...). A theme only has to provide 8 base
# colours: bg0, fg0, red, green, yellow, blue, purple, aqua. Every slot it
# does not set itself is derived from those by blending. Slots a theme does
# set are kept, so hand-tuned themes (e.g. "Gruvbox Dark Hard") stay as they are
# and running this again changes nothing.
#
# Adding a theme: add a line with the 8 base colours to palettes.json, then
#   jq -r -f palette-derive.jq palettes.json > /tmp/p.json && mv /tmp/p.json palettes.json
